# ML_project_M1

This a repo for a machine learning project realised with one colleague during my first year of master degree in Data Science, Agrocampus Ouest.

We have explored different basic algorithm (Knn, naive bayes, logistical regression and SVM) for binomial supervised classification on health data.
